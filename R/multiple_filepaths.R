#' @title Obtain a tibble of filepaths
#' @description Obtain a tibble of filepaths by supplying directory paths and pattern (if necessary) of files.
#' @param path A vector of paths for which to obtain the filepaths to specific files
#' @param pattern NULL by default does not supply a pattern of files to obtain.
#' If a pattern is required input a vector of patterns that align with the paths supplied.
#' @param full.names TRUE by default. Arguement passed to list.files(). Returns full path of file.
#' @param sort TRUE by default will sort the filepaths by a subject ID contained inside of the path. FALSE will not sort.
#' @param id_pattern By default is a 3 digit pattern. Searches for the pattern indicated as a subject ID.

#' @return A tibble of filepaths.
